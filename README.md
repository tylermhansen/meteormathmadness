# meteormathmadness
This game was my submission to the 2017 Congressional App Challenge. I created as a way for young children to improve their mental math skills. The game was actually used by the students of one of my elementary school teachers! http://highschool.spsd.org/meteormultiplication/index.html

# Unfortunately, these are just the build files, as I cannot find the source code. Probably for the best, since it was written in 2017, and my practices were likely far from ideal.
